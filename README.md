## What's Your Daily Check-Up?
As we approach 2025, we often check various types of data daily: stock prices, exchange rates, cryptocurrency prices, weather updates, and more. To access this information, we usually visit dedicated websites for each category of interest.

Wouldn't it be convenient to have a single widget that consolidates all your favorite numbers in one place?

Initially, I considered implementing this idea using [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky), but its functionality is limited to local environments. By making it public, contributors could easily add more valuable data sources to enhance the widget.

Currently, the repository maintainer hosts this widget on their personal local server, but you can also host it on your own server if desired.

## How to run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
